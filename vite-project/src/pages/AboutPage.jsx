          <h3>Felipe</h3>
          <p>
            Felipe's journey into the heart of EquiStay began with his
            insatiable curiosity and a backpack. Born to a family of
            storytellers, he grew up mesmerized by tales of distant lands and
            cultures. This fascination soon turned into a quest, leading him to
            traverse continents, armed only with his charm and a keen ability to
            pick up languages as if they were souvenirs. Whether it was haggling
            over spices in the souks of Marrakech or sharing stories with monks
            in the mountains of Nepal, Felipe believed in the power of words to
            bridge worlds. His adventures were not just travels but missions to
            uncover the universal language of kindness, laughter, and shared
            meals. It was this passion for connection and understanding that
            inspired the ethos of EquiStay: a world connected through stories
            and experiences, transcending barriers one conversation at a time.

          <h3>Mirko</h3>
          <p>
            Mirko's path to co-founding EquiStay was paved with green intentions
            and muddy boots. A true eco-warrior at heart, his childhood was
            spent in the embrace of nature, where he learned the intricate
            dances of ecosystems and the importance of living in harmony with
            the earth. His adventures began in the pursuit of sustainable
            solutions, from the jungles of Borneo to the reefs of the Great
            Barrier Reef, where he witnessed both the beauty of nature and the
            impact of human negligence. Mirko's mission was clear: to inspire
            change through action. Armed with a degree in environmental science
            and a spirit that couldn't be dampened, he set out to integrate
            sustainability into the very fabric of travel. At EquiStay, Mirko is
            the driving force behind green initiatives, championing eco-friendly
            practices and teaching travelers and hosts alike how small changes
            can make a big difference, one stay at a time.
